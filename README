Braincalc
By Vernon Swanepoel

A simple game to test your ability to do some mental arithmatic

I started working on it in C, while learning C (which I'm still busy with)
but wanted it to work already as part of my daily habit of keeping my 
pip fresh, so I wrote a quick version in python - brainc.py

I'd like to finish the C version, and perhaps extend the python
version a bit (such as with command line options)
