Braincalc
By Vernon Swanepoel

A simple game to test your ability to do some mental arithmatic

Based on the idea behind "Train Your Brain", a book by
Dr. Kawashima, simple math is a great way to sharpen
your brain a bit.  I'm not sure how right he is, but I
thought it would be a fun c programming excercise to try
to implement this in a console program.

Developed on Debian GNU/Linux as a Linux console
application

To compile the program:
cp into the directory and type 'make'

to play the game:
usr@computer:~$ ./brain

Optionally:
usr@computer:~$ ./brain h      # for help
usr@computer:~$ ./brain 10     # for number of turns
usr@computer:~$ ./brain 10 10  # for number of turns and max values

There is no timer (yet), so you can run with time:
usr@computer:~$ time ./brain h      # use bash to time your progress
